# recent-file-search

A simple GUI program to search a parent folder and show recently created files (filtered by type)
grouped by the folder in which they are located.

Initial use case (the inspiration) was a huge collection of pdfs and epubs sorted by folders and the inability 
(to do it easily) in Windows to look for the latest obtained books from each category (folder).
